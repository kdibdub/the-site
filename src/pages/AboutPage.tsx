          <p>
            I am a software developer and recent graduate from BYU's Computer
            Science program. I have a passion for creating and learning new
            things. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow
            as a developer. My experience includes web development, and mobile
            development. I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from
            small personal projects to large scale applications. I am excited to
            see where my career will take me and what new things I will learn
            along the way.
